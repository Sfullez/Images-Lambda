# Images-Lambda
## Overview
![Overview of the entire architecture](https://i.imgur.com/aOXSKAU.png)
Final assignment for the Parallel Computing course at Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze, developed together with [Federico Palai](http://github.com/palai103).

This Lambda Architecture retrieves images from Google and Bing, based on a given keyword, and processes them in order to show the user the most relevant images for the given query. Image features are extracted using the CEDD descriptor.

A more complete analysis of the project can be found in the paper.
## Usage
In order to use this architecture, Hadoop must be started and a new namenode must be created. Example, from the Hadoop installation directory:

    bin/hdfs namenode -format
	sbin/start-all.sh

Then, the Spring Boot web application and the Cassandra database must be started: as soon as a query is sent by a client from the front-end, batch and speed layer will be started automatically by the driver. Example:

    sudo service cassandra start
    jar springboot-artifact-name.jar
